# Ray-Tracing-CPP-v2

I made this program following the Ray Tracing in One Weekend books series by: Peter Shirley. You can find the most recent edition of the book series at this [here](https://raytracing.github.io/) or the version I used [v3.2.3](https://raytracing.github.io/v3/index.html).

An extension that I have added to this program that wasn't covered in the boom was functionality to save the render to a BMP file instead of just the simple plain text PPM P3 format. I did this using the code in [stb_image_write.h](/stb_image_write.h) which was written by Sean Barrett.
